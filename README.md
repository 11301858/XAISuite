## Introduction

XAISuite (E<b>x</b>planatory <b>A</b>rtificial <b>I</b>ntelligence <b>Suite</b>) is a library for training and explaining machine learning models for tabular datasets in Python. It provides a unified interface for training any sklearn model using just a line of code and allows users to easily comparing the results of different explainers!

XAISuite accomplishes machine learning model training and explanation generation in three steps: (1) data loading, (2) model training and (3)
explanation generation. Each of these steps are delved into more detail in our [documentation](https://11301858.github.io/XAISuite/v0.6.7-beta/index.html) and in the demo tutorials.


![Basic Flowchart of how XAISuite works](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66180831/209634297-296fa5d8-4429-434c-afaa-7500d776cd75.png)

XAISuite was created as a helper library to [this paper](insert link), which studied the difference in SHAP and LIME explanations for different models on tabular datasets.

## Installation
You can install the ``XAI Suite`` through PyPI:

``
pip install XAISuite
``

## Getting Started

For example code and an introduction to the library, see the Demo Folder. 

If you are looking for a model or dataset to use, [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) has several cool options.


## How to Contribute

We welcome the contribution from the open-source community to improve the library!

To add a new functionality into the library or point out a flaw, please create a new issue on Github. We'll try to look into your requests as soon as we can.
