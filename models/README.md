Want to include a custom model in XAISuite so that users can directly access it? 

Write your model and submit a pull request to add your .py file to this folder. Your custom model will be reviewed for security issues and XAISuite compatibility. 

If your model is approved, it will be found here and automatically integrated into XAISuite.

The model must have fit() and score() methods.
