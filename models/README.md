Want to include a custom model in XAISuite that is not supported? 

Write your model (it must be sklearn compatible) and submit a pull request to add your .py file by pull request to this folder. Your custom model will be reviewed for security issues and XAISuite compatibility. 

If your model is approved, it will be found here and automatically integrated into XAISuite.
