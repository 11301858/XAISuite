This is the home of all XAIHub explainers. The purpose of this is to serve as a repository of all explainers. Are we missing an explainer or do you have a novel explainer to add? File a pull request. 

As of the current version, the explainers in this folder may not be compatible with the XAISuite python library. This feature was introduced in v 2.0.0. Its purpose is to allow users to use their own explanatory methods within the XAISuite framework, in addition to buil-ins like SHAP or LIME.
